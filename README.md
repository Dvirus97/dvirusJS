# DvirusJs

This is my library. 

small things that i played with. 

This library is separated into some sections.
- vanilla section 
    - this code is for every JS/TS app.
    - there are all kind of utils
        - some for http
        - some for handle errors
        - dom manipulations
        - and many more

---
At the end of each file i added a `usage example` code. hope thats help.
