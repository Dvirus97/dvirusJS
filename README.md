# DvirusJs

This is my library. 

small things that i played with. 

This library is separated into some sections.
- vanilla section 
    - this code is for every JS/TS app.
    - there are all kind of utils
        - some for http
        - some for handle errors
        - dom manipulations
        - and many more
     
- angular section
    - signals utils
        - signalOrValue
            - signal<T> | T
        - convert object to SignalObj
            - object that all its values are signals
        - convert signalObj to plain object.
    - signalForm
        - manage your form state with signals.
        - handle: state, errors, warnings, disabled, touched, dirty.
        - work with groups, arrays, and premitives.
    - clickOutside directive
        - emits event when you click outside the target element.
